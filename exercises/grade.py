# # A program to Compute Student score and display appropriate grade.

# # 70 - 100 = A
# # 60 - 69  = B
# # 50 - 59 = C
# # 40 - 49 = D
# # 0 - 44 = F
# # Invalid score.

# # ALGORITHM

# # Get the score from student
# #  Check the score and determine the grade
# #  Display the appropriate grade for each score

# student_score = int(input("Enter your score in numbers: "))

# # Test the conditions
# if student_score >= 70 and student_score <= 100:
#     print("Grade - A")
# elif student_score >= 60 and student_score <= 69:
#     print("Grade - B")
# elif student_score >= 50 and student_score <= 59:
#     print("Grade - C")
# elif student_score >= 40 and student_score <= 49:
#     print("Grade - D")
# elif student_score >= 0 and student_score <= 44:
#     print("Grade - F")
